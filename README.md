# COVID-19 Analysis-AHodge
mad-economist

Just as an econmist pursuing data science for making inference about economic and social environment. For in God I trust for all other things bring data.
 
This is my first attempt at using Github, deploying a few R scripts I have used to analyse the COVID-19 situation. I dont profess to be a epidemologist but I understand trends and growth rates.
